# Q-Learning-Hyperparameter-Experiment
This project investigates how the learning rate alpha, discount factor gamma, and exploration rate epsilon affect the performance of Q-learning in a 10$\times$10 GridWorld. The goal is to explore the trade-offs in Q-learning performance due to these hyperparameters, using a fixed layout with 20 obstacles.
